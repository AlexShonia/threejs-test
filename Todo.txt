+ Understand whats goin on
+ add terrain
+ fix movement on terrain
+ add fps counter
+ Add trees
+ model your tree
+ get better skybox 
understand why are there minuses in character movement code
+ add shadows
break up the code into function&files
add a way to increase speed while playing
    scroll? or some keypress?
improve your tree
    + decrease leaves resolution
        + more!
    improve visually
    - Join both materials
    + Join leaf meshes into single one
    - Join tree and leaf into single mesh and bake a whole texture on them

Optimizing models:
    use gltfpack
    use BASIS textures

TreeGeneration
    + use mesh instancing like the monkey example: https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_instancing_performance
    + either join the meshes or something like that
    + probably improving tree model will make the job easier
    + use floorGeometry vertices to generate them

add custom Print function with framecount
    
Fog
    set sky.material.fog to true so its affected by fog
    Cut the shader sphere up so that top 30% is left
    then do the same shader somehow on it
    so that you have blue sky and gardamavali fog too

Check if sizes matches real world

Big Fps Drop was caused by Terrain
    + Understand terrain generation, fix terrain to be more natural

Does window.Math.random overwrite the random fro whole file?

Diversify trees by having some without leaves
